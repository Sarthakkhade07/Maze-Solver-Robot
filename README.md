# Maze-Solver-Robot
Built an autonomous maze-solving robot that navigates through a maze using real-time distance sensing and decision-making algorithms. The robot intelligently detects walls and open paths using ultrasonic sensors and follows a wall-following strategy to traverse the maze without human intervention.
